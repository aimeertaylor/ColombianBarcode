Skype With Diego 24th Oct 2018


- Illegal gold mining thought to be responsible for recent resurgence of cases. - Quibó (capital of Choco). Very rainy and bio diverse, but one of poorest places in Colombia. Many people and increasing looking for gold. 
- Diego went to Quidbó, river Atrató contaminated with gold slurry. Complete mess.
- Evidence of heavy gold mining machinery from Brazil. Not sure how transported. Diego going to follow-up on possibility of river + road route: Brazil –> Laticia (Amazon capital) -> Choco 
- Diego has contacts in Quidbó (need local contacts to get info.)

- Depending on place, prevalence of asymptomatic malaria estimated at 10% - 15% by PCR (skype with Diego, approx. 5 papers available)

- Malaria transmission is remarkably low in Ecuador, despite high transmission in Nariño and people traveling from Colombia to Ecuador. 

- Lack of malaria in Esmerelda is not understood 
- In fact, at the PAVO(?) meetings, possible importation from Colombia into Ecuador is a main concern.
